# Walking Stalking Robots Website
I built this website for my band [Walking Stalking Robots](https://walkingstalkingrobots.com)

## Technologies Used
The project was built as a Node JS application and used some open source designs from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) while also utilizing [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). I also used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but that is pretty obvious... 

It also uses some weather information from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov) as a random number generator. 

It is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
